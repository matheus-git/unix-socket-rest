![rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)

A small Rust project that sets up a simple client-server communication using Unix Domain Sockets (UDS). It lets you send and receive data about people (like name and age) using a lightweight, REST-like message format.

**This project was developed in just a few hours as part of a training exercise over the weekend.**
